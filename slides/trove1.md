## Tags and comments
<hr />

<span class="fragment">
"Applications distributed via the G**gle Play store are signed by the developer of the application, and the Android operating system checks that updates are signed with the same key, preventing others from distributing updates that the developer themselves did not sign"
</span>
<br />

<span class="fragment">
"When F-Droid signs the binaries, the application user needs to trust F-Droid rather than the developer of the application, that no malicious update to an application is distributed"
</span>
