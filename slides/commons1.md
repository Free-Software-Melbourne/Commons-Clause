## F/LOSS, Creative Commons And The Digital Commons
<hr />

### Pioneers Of Digital Commons

Free Software movement

Open Source

Wikipedia

Open Hardware

<br />
<br />

### A Popular Modern Interpretation

The Internet

Note:
- One of the first examples of digital commons is the Free Software movement, founded in the 1980s
- To prevent the misuse of software created by the movement, Stallman founded the GNU General Public License
- Examples of digital commons are Wikipedia, free software and open-source hardware projects
<hr />
- Mayo Fuster Morell (social researcher) proposed a definition of digital commons as "information and knowledge resources that are collectively created and owned or shared between or among a community and that tend to be non-exclusive, that is, be (generally freely) available to third parties. Thus, they are oriented to favor use and reuse, rather than to exchange as a commodity. Additionally, the community of people building them can intervene in the governing of their interaction processes and of their shared resources
<hr />
- The distinction between digital commons and other digital resources is that the community of people building them can intervene in the governing of their interaction processes and of their shared resources
- Resources are typically designed to be used by the community by which they are created
<hr />
- Today the digital commons takes the form of the Internet

## Tragedy Of The Digital Commons
<hr />

### The Tragedies
Exploiting common resources

Pollution of Infosphere

Corruption of communication

Anti-Competitive Behavior

### "Commoning" As A Process To Stop A Tragedy

Process of coming together to manage such resources

Commoning is a learning process

Failure of some commons might result in the creation of new ones

Note:
- it would'nt be a talk about the commons without a "Tragedy of" slide
- the average user of the information technology (Infosphere) behaves in the way Hardin's herdsmen behave by exploiting common resources until they no longer can recover, meaning that users do not pay attention to the consequences of their behaviour
- This brings excess information that leads to corruption of communication and information overload. An example of this is spam, which takes up to 45% of email traffic.
- artificial agents, like worms, that can self-replicate and spread
- anti-competitive behavior
<hr />
- commoning: coming together to manage such resources, by the community who governs it
- commoning can be temporary and this does not entail a problem or a failure.
- Commoning is a learning process
- the so-called failure of some commons might result in the creation of new ones

===

## Sidenote - Source-Available Software
<hr />

### The Source-Available Model
The "One (or two) Freedoms"

Often included in distributions or available on request

Proprietary compatibility

### Examples
- TrueCrypt License
- SugarCRM Public License
- Server Side Public License - Mongo
- Microsoft Shared Source Initiative
- Mega Limited Code Review Licence
- GitLab Enterprise Edition License
- Commons Clause

Note:
- less frequently used term
- arrangements where the source can be viewed, and in some cases modified, but without necessarily meeting the criteria to be called open-source
- as long its source code is distributed along with it, even if the user has no legal rights to use, share, modify or even compile it
- It is possible for a software to be both source available software and proprietary software
- Commons Clause is a source-available license that is less liberal than permissive open source licenses

===

## The Commons Clause License
<hr />

### “Commons Clause” License Condition v1.0
- The Software is provided to you by the Licensor under the License, as defined below, subject to the following condition.
- Without limiting other conditions in the License, the grant of rights under the License will not include, and the License does not grant to you,  right to Sell the Software.
- For purposes of the foregoing, “Sell” means practicing any or all of the rights granted to you under the License to provide to third parties, for a fee or other consideration (including without limitation fees for hosting or consulting/ support services related to the Software), a product or service whose value derives, entirely or substantially, from the functionality of the Software.  Any license notice or attribution required by the License must also include this Commons Cause License Condition notice.
- Software: [name software]
- License: [i.e. Apache 2.0]
- Licensor: [ABC company]

Note:
- focused on the rights of sale
- applies a narrow, minimal-form commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license to transition the project to a source-availability licensing scheme
- intended as an add-on to liberal licences
- all permissions of the original license to remain except the ability to "Sell" the software as defined in the text
- You just can’t sell a product that consists in substance of the Commons Clause software and does not add value.. the value add is the maintenance of the commons
- It allows you more commercial freedom in some ways than copyleft or reciprocal open source licenses
- They can even offer the software as-a-service internally for employees
- To anyone wishing to sell the Commons Clause licensed software itself, an action that the license prohibits, it appears proprietary, in the sense that it would be necessary to negotiate a license to do that with the owner of the Commons Clause software
- The promotors say: we only wanted to restrict one narrow kind of commercial use

## Commons Clause - How Did It Happen?
<hr />
<br />
<br />

CEOs and Chief Counsils meet
<br />
<br />

Commision Heather J. Meeker to author the licence
<br />
<br />

Redis Labs
  
Note:
- Who wants this? in 2018 CEOs and chief counsels of two dozen at-scale open-source companies, some of them public, meet to talk about what to do about Amazon
- August 2018 Redis Labs announced their decision to add this rider - Apache + Commons Clause
- The people behind this initiative are committed open-source advocates, and our intent is to protect open source from an existential threat


===

## An Appeal To Authority
<hr />
<br />
<br />

Heather J. Meeker is a respected attorney
<br />
<br />

With a History in open source software licensing and strategy
<br />
<br />

Source licenses provide inherent authority
<br />
<br />

Drafted in the spirit of a copyleft licence



Note:
- found out about Commons Clause licence when I arrived at NENA, and it was the license most people I spoke to were interested in
- Heather J. Meeker: Specialist in open source software licensing and strategy and respected attorney
- Further, the Commons Clause’s use of an underlying and accepted open source license gives the clause some inherent authority. Viewed in this way, the Commons Clause is simply a minor change to already well-accepted and well-established open source licenses
- IPKitten: Commons Clause is drafted in the spirit of a copyleft licence, thereby aiming to protect source code availability

===

## At Least It's Not Proprietary
<hr />
<br />
<br />

Not intended to replace licenses
<br />
<br />

Fulfils urgent business requirements without resorting to fully "closing source"
<br />
<br />

Better than nothing
<br />
<br />

As good as we can do for now
<br />
<br />

Note:
- This Clause is not intended to replace licenses of existing open source projects in general, but to be used by specific projects to satisfy urgent business or legal requirements without resorting to fully "closing source"
- So if anyone tries to convince you that Commons Clause is wrong because it doesn't meet all the requirements of the Open Source Definition, you should ask them if proprietary is better
- good enough, or better than nothing
- IP Kitten: the choice is often between the full proprietary route and a source-available licensing. By choosing the latter, we may preserve at least some of the freedoms

===

## Negotiation, Funding and Anti-competitive Behavior
<hr />
<br />
<br />

FLOSS projects are often funded by a proprietary offering/service counterparts
<br />
<br />

Intended to force a negotiation
<br />
<br />

Aims to reduce/eliminate predatory commercial practices
- Unless the Commons Clause code is a minor part of a larger software product, or
- You provide maintenance, support or professional services

Note:
- Wang: "Open-source software projects are mainly funded by a proprietary offering/service counterparts. Anything to help this layer monetize is good -- the fate of the OSS is directly funded by it.
- Freedom for others to commercialize your software comes with starting an open source project, and while that freedom is important to uphold, growth and commercial pressures will inevitably force some projects to close
<hr />
- intended to force a negotiation between the developers of open source software and “those who take predatory commercial advantage of open source development.”
- The Commons Clause was intended, in practice, to have virtually no effect other than force a negotiation with those who take predatory commercial advantage of open source development
<hr />
- Updegrove wrote Commons Clause is "simple in concept: basically, it gives a developer the right to make sure no one can make money out of her code -- whether by selling, hosting, or supporting it -- unless the Commons Clause code is a minor part of a larger software product".
- Some have misconstrued that it prevents people from offering maintenance, support or professional services
- Commons Clause prohibits a cloud service provider from copying open source software, rebranding it, and selling a cloud-based product or service whose value derives entirely or substantially from the software’s functionality
- open-source software was never intended for cloud infrastructure companies to take and sell. That is not the original ethos of open source. Commons Clause is reviving the original ethos of open source


===

## Is It better Than AGPL And Creative Commons?
<hr />

### AGPL

AGPL does not prevent cloud infrastructure providers from engaging in anticompetitive behavior

Ambiguity of the "network clause" in AGPL

Improvements often fall outside of the “Program”

Software patents

AGPL does not focus on the rights of developers

### Creative Commons

Not software licenses

One narrow kind of commercial use

Note:
- AGPL makes it inconvenient but does not prevent cloud infrastructure providers from engaging in the abusive behavior described above. It simply says that they must release any modifications they make while engaging in such behavior.
- may be preferable over the AGPL because the AGPL cannot prevent cloud service providers from selling functionality of the software
- AGPL doesn't go far enough to preserve the rights of developers. If cloud-based software is licensed under AGPL, often, much of the value for improvements to the cloud-based software arguably falls outside of the “Program”
- ambiguity of what is covered by AGPL’s network clause (“interacting ..remotely through a computer network”) means that many potential users are more confused and cautious about using AGPL
- AGPL contains language about software patents that is unnecessary and disliked by a number of enterprises
<hr />
- CC-NC is a similar idea, but CC licenses are not software licenses. we only wanted to restrict one narrow kind of commercial use

===

## Criticisms - From The FSF And OSI
<hr />

### FSF

Nonfree - forbids selling - simple

### OSI

Does not satisfy the OSI Open Source Definition

Applying the clause to an approved licence instantly renders it non-approved

Redis just went proprietary

Violates OSD Clauses
  - 1 - Free Redistribution
  - 3 - Derived Works
  - 5 - No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
  - 6 - No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor

Note:
- FSF: “Commons Clause” is a nonfree license because it forbids selling copies of the program, and even running the program as part of implementing any commercial service
<hr />
- changes an OSI-approved license into a license that does not satisfy the OSI Open Source Definition: "Adding a significant clause to an existing license that has been approved by OSI instantly renders it non-approved
- the text of the so-called 'Commons Clause,' which actually fences off the commons
- is clearly intended to violate clause 1 of the Open Source Definition and probably also violates clauses 3, 5 and 6. As such adding this clause to a license would be a major abrogation of software freedom removing essential rights from any affected open-source community."
- Simon Phipps, president of the Open Source Initiative (OSI): "Redis just went proprietary, which sucks. No, this is not just 'a limitation concerning fair use,' it is an abrogation of software freedom."

===

## Criticisms - Proprietary Software
<hr />
<br />
<br />

Turning open-source software into proprietary software?
<br />
<br />

Seeks to hide a power imbalance ironically behind the guise of "open source sustainability"
<br />
<br />

It's just not "open source"
<br />
<br />

Note:
- It really sucks when companies are using your work to make money for themselves. If a solution presents itself, it's tempting to jump at it. But the Commons Clause doesn't present a solution for supporting open-source software. It presents a framework for turning open-source software into proprietary software
- Bradley M Kuhn: This proprietary software license, which is not open source and does not respect the four freedoms of free software, seeks to hide a power imbalance ironically behind the guise 'open source sustainability.'
- Commons Clause makes software not open source, which is accurate

===

## Criticisms - Confusion About Support And Consulting
<hr />
<br />
<br />

Can you host the licensed software for free and charge a fee for customer support or consulting
<br />
<br />

  - Some say "Yes"
  - Others "No"


Note:
- A plain reading of this provision suggests that a cloud service provider cannot host the licensed software for free and charge a fee for customer support or consulting relating to the software’s functionality (e.g., how to use the software).
- The Commons Clause documentation refers to a discussion board suggesting that consulting may be permitted, but the language of the clause appear to suggest otherwise
- IP Kitten: prohibits hosting or offering consulting or support services as "a product or service whose value derives, entirely or substantially, from the functionality of the software"
- Unfortunate that updates have not been made

===

## Other Criticisms
<hr />
<br />
<br />

It doesn't really solve the problem
<br />
<br />

This trend could snowball (or has it already)
<br />
<br />

Could reduce, and does restrict the reuse of a project
<br />
<br />

Confusion caused by similarity in names
<br />
<br />

Ambiguous definition of "substantial derivative"

Note:
- Karen Sandler: "highlights the fundamental problems connected to the wide adoption of non-copyleft licenses, but I think it doesn't really solve the problem that it seeks to solve. What we really need is strong copyleft licenses where the copyrights are held diversely by individuals"
- "it would be a very disturbing development if the release of the Commons Clause inspired more people to come up with their own license 'extensions', especially if they are also not compliant with the Open Software Definition and the Four Freedoms."
<hr />
- Reuse: "Developers should be clear in advance what their goals are when they're put their fingers to their keys. Commons Clause-licensed software is not likely to get the same amount of reuse as might otherwise be the case."
- Updegrove: "In one way, that's in the spirit of a copyleft license, but it also violates the 'Four Freedoms' of free and open-source software as well as the Open Source Definition by placing restrictions on reuse, among other issues."
<hr />
- A developer may incorrectly assume by the similarity in their names that these licenses can be interpreted exactly the same as the Apache 2.0 license
This could lead to a confusing open source landscape, where multiple different licenses have similar names -- but I'd argue that CC does not suffer this -- and this already happens, I think some standardization (like CC) could be good
- IP kitten: Combining a known and trusted open source license with a proprietary (i.e., non-open source) rider  with unknown implications is set to cause user confusion
<hr />
- vague substantial derivative


===

## The Future...
<hr />
<br />
<br />

No further revisions in 2 years
<br />
<br />

Reshaping the portfolio of freedoms
<br />
<br />

Individual company license trend continues
<br />
<br />

Note:
- no further revisions in 2 years
- IPKitten: Indeed reshaping the portfolio of freedoms may not necessarily be  a threat to open source as we know it,  but rather an evolution thereof
- companies are making their own now
